This document will contain all changes made to my site since HW3 as well as explanations of my code

Changes:
1. A new navigation link, called HW4, was added to the index.html navbar. This link can be used to access my HW4 pages.

Part 1:
I used a script tag to insert javascript for this part. I add event listeners to all buttons and use setTimeout to give the DOM time to clear the output element's innerHtml before the prompts appear to the user. I found that some delay was needed or else the output would still be visible on the page, which is not the case in the demo video.
